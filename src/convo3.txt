Minimact Discussion Summary
What Minimact Is
Converts TSX → C# → HTML patches using a Babel plugin
Rust reconciliation layer handles diffing and predicting next patches
Supports React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for SSR + interactivity
Built-in Markdown and template rendering
Context
Built for a .NET enterprise app at a navy contractor company
Goal: avoid Next.js complexity while staying in the .NET ecosystem
Strict deployment environments with security requirements
Key Innovation: Zero-Cost Semantic Hooks
Instead of manual useState patterns, you're building high-level hooks that:

Compile away via Babel plugin (no bundle cost)
Generate optimized C# patch code
Enable batched state updates for semantic actions
Provide better DX without runtime overhead
Hook Ideas Discussed
Existing:

useMarkdown, useTemplate
Validation:

useValidation - Babel plugin wires input + error target elements together automatically
UI State Machines:

useToggle - atomic on/off pattern
useModal - composite pattern (state + backdrop + animations)
Middle tier: useAccordion, useTabs, useDropdown, useDisclosure
The Big Idea: Route-as-Parameter
Hooks can accept route strings for type-safe server data:

tsx
const dropdown = useDropdown('/api/units'); // Full TypeScript intellisense
Babel plugin:

Detects route string
Looks up generated TypeScript types (via NSwag/similar)
Generates C# fetching code
Provides full type safety
Pattern applies across hooks: useDropdown, useTabs, useValidation, useTable, etc.

Philosophy
High-level semantic abstractions over manual state management
Let .NET handle complexity - Minimact focuses on UI patterns only
Surgical, minimal changes - not complexity for complexity's sake
Inspired by Vue's philosophy of elegant, intuitive APIs
Yes but it wouldn't just be strings, also intellisense

You're absolutely right - I undersold that.

Route-as-Parameter with Intellisense
Not just passing strings, but full IDE autocomplete on your API routes:

tsx
const dropdown = useDropdown(Routes.Api.Units.GetAll);
//                            ^ Intellisense shows all available routes
The generated TypeScript definitions from your C# controllers would include:

All route paths
Method names
Parameter requirements
Return types
So when you type Routes. you get a dropdown of all your API endpoints, organized by controller. Pick one, and the hook is fully typed with the response type.

This means:

No typos in route strings
Refactor-safe (rename in C#, TypeScript updates)
Discover available endpoints via intellisense
Full type safety end-to-end: C# → route definition → hook data type
The Babel plugin sees Routes.Api.Units.GetAll, resolves it to the actual endpoint and return type, then generates the appropriate C# fetching code.

So it's not just type-safe, it's discoverable and refactor-safe too. That's the full picture.
