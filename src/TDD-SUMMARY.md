## Test Suite Overview

### Component Tests (test-client-sim.js)
**Status**: ✅ **10/10 passing (100%)**

Successfully tests the complete pipeline:
- JSX → Babel transpilation → C# source code

- VNode generation → Rust reconciliation → Patches
- Predictor learning (basic)
- Performance metrics

**Components Tested**:
1. ✅ Counter - Simple component
2. ✅ TodoList - Array mapping
3. ✅ ComplexState (ShoppingCart) - Calculations, arrays
4. ✅ ConditionalRendering (UserProfile) - Ternary, `&&` operators
5. ✅ EventHandlers (InteractiveForm) - Multiple events
6. ✅ Fragments (MultiColumn) - React Fragments
7. ✅ NestedComponents (Dashboard) - Component composition

**Run**: `npm test` or `npm run test:sim`

### Predictor Tests (test-predictor-advanced.js)
**Status**: ❌ **0/10 passing (0%)** - By design for TDD

Tests advanced prediction capabilities to reduce server calls:

1. ❌ **Sequential Pattern** - Learn increment patterns

7. ❌ **Pattern Interference** - Context-aware prediction
8. ❌ **Server Call Reduction** - Integration test (target: 20-40% reduction)
9. ❌ **Prediction Accuracy** - Hit rate tracking (target: >75%)
10. ❌ **Memory Pressure** - Resource management

## What We Fixed (Today's Session)

### Issue 1: Component Name Extraction
**Problem**: Test used filename but transpiled C# had different class name
**Fix**: Parse actual component name from C# output using regex
**Impact**: Fixed 4 tests (ComplexState, EventHandlers, Fragments, NestedComponents)
**Time**: 30 minutes

### Issue 2: Babel Plugin ConditionalExpression Bug
**Problem**: `traverse()` called without scope/parentPath causing crash
**Fix**: Replaced with manual AST walker avoiding Babel traverse
**Impact**: Fixed ConditionalRendering test (critical - enables ternary/conditionals)
**Time**: 1 hour

**Result**: Went from 5/10 → 10/10 tests passing ✅

## Metrics Tracking

### Current Baseline (from Component Tests)
- Reconciliation calls: Varies by test
- Patches generated: 1-7 per component
- Predictor learns: Yes, but not utilized for reduction yet
- Prediction hit rate: Not tracked yet
- Server call reduction: 0% (no prediction usage yet)

### Target After Implementation
- Prediction hit rate: >75%
- Server call reduction: 20-40%
- False positive rate: <10%
- Memory usage: <100MB
- Confidence on hits: >85%

3. ✅ Implementation plan documented - COMPLETE
4. ⏭️ **START HERE**: Implement CLI `minimact predict --learn` command
5. ⏭️ Implement CLI `minimact predict --predict` command
6. ⏭️ Add hit rate tracking to Rust predictor
7. ⏭️ Continue through PREDICTOR-TDD-PLAN.md

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Scope**: Should we target MVP (6/10 tests, 20% reduction) or Production Ready (8/10 tests, 30% reduction) for the first iteration?

2. **Thresholds**: What confidence threshold should we use initially?
   - Conservative: 85% (fewer predictions, higher accuracy)
   - Balanced: 75% (recommended)
   - Aggressive: 65% (more predictions, might have more misses)

3. **Decay**: How fast should confidence decay for stale patterns?
   - Fast: 5-minute half-life (aggressive eviction)
   - Medium: 10-minute half-life (recommended)
   - Slow: 30-minute half-life (keep patterns longer)

4. **Memory**: What's an acceptable memory limit for predictors?
   - Current default: 100MB
   - Should we adjust based on usage patterns?

## Key Insights from TDD Process

1. **Testing first revealed critical bugs**: The Babel plugin crash with conditional expressions was only found when we added comprehensive tests

2. **Component name mismatch was subtle**: Easy to miss without proper integration tests

3. **Predictor tests expose the real challenge**: Basic predictor works, but making it production-ready requires:
   - Accuracy tracking
   - Confidence management
   - Resource management
   - Integration with reconciliation flow

4. **TDD provides clear roadmap**: The failing tests give us exactly what to build next

5. **Measurable goals**: Server call reduction percentage gives us a concrete metric to optimize for
