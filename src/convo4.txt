What about useGrid or useSignalR...

Oh yes! Both of those make total sense.

useGrid - Perfect for enterprise apps:

tsx
const grid = useGrid('/api/records', {
  sortable: true,
  filterable: true,
  paginated: true
});
Fetches data from route
Built-in sorting/filtering/pagination state
Generates optimized patches for just the changed rows
Your Rust reconciliation layer would shine here
useSignalR - Real-time updates:

tsx
const notifications = useSignalR('/hubs/notifications');
Connects to your SignalR hub
Automatically patches DOM when messages arrive
Could integrate with your Rust prediction layer for optimistic updates
Critical for navy apps that need live status updates
These are both very .NET-native patterns - SignalR is Microsoft's real-time solution, and grids are everywhere in enterprise apps.

And they follow your pattern:

Route as parameter
Type-safe from C# definitions
Compile to efficient patch generation
Zero extra bundle cost
useSignalR especially could be powerful - real-time collaboration, live dashboards, status monitoring. All the stuff navy contractors need.

Which one feels more immediately useful for your actual work scenarios?

What about usePub or useSub for the pub/sub pattern

Oh, that's cleaner! Separate concerns instead of one monolithic useSignalR.

tsx
// Publishing component
const publish = usePub('/hubs/notifications');
publish({ type: 'alert', message: 'Status updated' });

// Subscribing component
const messages = useSub('/hubs/notifications', (msg) => {
  // Handle incoming message
});
This is better because:

Components declare their role - publisher vs subscriber
More composable - mix and match as needed
Clearer intent - you know what each component does
Lighter weight - only wire up what you need
And it maps naturally to SignalR's actual API while staying abstract enough to work with other pub/sub systems.

Your Babel plugin would:

Generate C# SignalR hub connections
Wire up publishers to send methods
Wire up subscribers to receive handlers
Batch related patches when multiple subscribers react
Could even do:

tsx
const status = useSub('/hubs/status');
const grid = useGrid(status); // Grid updates from real-time feed
Compose the hooks together. Very Vue-like in its simplicity.

Does this feel like the right granularity for real-time patterns?

No, I was thinking for an event aggregator, not signal R, though we could do both

Ah! So usePub/useSub for client-side event aggregation - component-to-component communication without prop drilling.

tsx
// ComponentA.tsx
const publish = usePub('user-action');
publish({ action: 'itemSelected', id: 123 });

// ComponentB.tsx (elsewhere in tree)
useSub('user-action', (event) => {
  // React to the event
});
Pure client-side coordination between components. No server involved.

Then separately, you'd have:

tsx
useSignalR('/hubs/notifications') // Server real-time
So:

usePub/useSub = client-side event bus
useSignalR = server real-time communication
Two different patterns, two different hooks. The event aggregator pattern is super useful for decoupled UI components - modals triggering refreshes, notifications, cross-component state sync.

And since it's client-only, your Babel plugin could generate really lightweight C# that just sets up the event wiring, while the actual pub/sub runtime lives in your Rust reconciliation layer.

That separation makes more sense. Did I get it right this time?

No, useSub would potentially return an object, that you could use in your JSX

Ah! So useSub returns reactive data that updates when events are published:

tsx
// ComponentA.tsx
const publish = usePub('cart-total');
publish({ total: 150 });

// ComponentB.tsx
const cartData = useSub('cart-total');

<div>Total: {cartData.total}</div>
// Automatically updates when published to
So it's not just a callback - it's reactive state that re-renders when the channel receives data.

The hook subscribes to a channel and gives you an object that stays in sync. When anyone publishes to that channel, all subscribers get the updated data and their components re-render (via patches).

tsx
const userData = useSub('user-profile');
<span>{userData.name}</span>

const notifications = useSub('alerts');
<div>{notifications.count} new alerts</div>
Clean, declarative. The data flows through the event aggregator, and your patch system handles the DOM updates.

Is that the mental model?

Yes, exactly. Then you can have an error property, or a waiting property with the number of milliseconds or whatever you need, like maybe the component it came from, or when it was sent

Perfect! So useSub returns a rich object with metadata:

tsx
const cartData = useSub('cart-total');

<div>
  {cartData.waiting && <Spinner duration={cartData.waiting} />}
  {cartData.error && <Error message={cartData.error} />}
  {cartData.value && <span>Total: {cartData.value.total}</span>}
  <small>From: {cartData.source} at {cartData.timestamp}</small>
</div>
The returned object could have:

value - the actual published data
error - if something went wrong
waiting - milliseconds until expected update
source - which component published it
timestamp - when it was sent
isStale - if data is old
Maybe retryCount, lastUpdated, etc.
This makes the pub/sub pattern observable and debuggable. You can see the flow of data through your app, handle loading states, show where data came from.

And all of this compiles down to efficient patches - your Babel plugin understands the structure and generates C# that tracks all this metadata automatically.

Really nice pattern. Very Vue/Solid-like in how it makes reactivity explicit and composable.

Yep, then you can have an optional function if you need a side-effect as well

Exactly! So you can use it declaratively in JSX, or add a callback for side effects:

tsx
// Just data binding
const cartData = useSub('cart-total');
<div>{cartData.value.total}</div>

// With side effect
const cartData = useSub('cart-total', (data) => {
  console.log('Cart updated:', data);
  trackAnalytics('cart-change');
  // Any imperative logic
});
<div>{cartData.value.total}</div>
Best of both worlds:

Declarative - data flows into your JSX automatically
Imperative - opt-in callback for side effects when you need them
Similar to how useEffect works, but tied specifically to pub/sub events. The callback is optional - if you just want reactive data, don't provide it. If you need to do something when data arrives, add the function.

Clean API. Flexible without being complicated.

This is really coming together nicely!

Then you can have useMicroTask or useMacroTask for targeted changes that should occur at certain times relative to painting

Oh nice! Controlling when updates happen relative to the browser's render cycle:

tsx
// Runs before paint - synchronous, immediate
useMicroTask(() => {
  // Critical DOM measurements, layout calculations
});

// Runs after paint - asynchronous, deferred
useMacroTask(() => {
  // Analytics, logging, non-critical updates
});
This gives you fine-grained control over the rendering pipeline:

useMicroTask - JavaScript microtask queue (Promise.then, queueMicrotask)
Read layout, measure DOM, prepare next frame
useMacroTask - Task queue (setTimeout, setImmediate)
Defer non-essential work until after paint
Could be really powerful combined with your Rust reconciliation:

tsx
const data = useSub('updates');

useMicroTask(() => {
  // Prepare optimizations before Rust reconciles
});

useMacroTask(() => {
  // Report metrics after patches applied
});
Or for animations:

tsx
const modal = useModal();

useMicroTask(() => {
  // Measure modal dimensions before animating
});
Gives developers escape hatches for performance-critical timing without breaking your patch model. Smart addition!

Then you can have usePredictHint, that lets the engine know about potential state changes in advance, so it can queue them up on the client

Brilliant! Feed your Rust prediction layer explicit hints:

tsx
const modal = useModal();

usePredictHint('modal-open', () => ({
  // Describe the likely next state
  backdrop: 'visible',
  content: 'slideIn',
  bodyScroll: 'locked'
}));

// Later...
modal.open(); // Rust already has patches queued, instant apply
Or for user interactions:

tsx
const dropdown = useDropdown('/api/units');

<button 
  onMouseEnter={() => usePredictHint('dropdown-open')}
  onClick={dropdown.open}
>
  Open Menu
</button>
// On hover, predict the dropdown will open
// On click, patches are already ready
This lets developers optimize critical paths by telling your prediction engine "this is likely to happen next, prepare for it."

The Rust layer can:

Pre-compute patches
Pre-fetch data
Queue DOM operations
Reduce time-to-interactive
Especially valuable for predictable user flows in your navy app - multi-step forms, drill-down dashboards, common workflows.

Makes your "prediction" feature collaborative rather than just automatic. Nice!
