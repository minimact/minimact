# Glossary

## A

### Anticipatory Rendering
A rendering strategy where the server predicts likely state changes and pre-computes DOM patches before the user acts. When the predicted action occurs, the client applies cached patches instantly (0.1-5ms) instead of waiting for a server round-trip. This is Minimact's core innovation.

### ASP.NET Core
Microsoft's cross-platform web framework for building server-side applications in C#. Minimact components run on ASP.NET Core, handling rendering, state management, and event processing.

### Attribute Patch
A DOM patch that updates an element's attribute (e.g., `class`, `style`, `disabled`). In Minimact, attribute hot reload takes ~0.1ms because it's a single `setAttribute()` call.

---

## B

### Babel Plugin
A JavaScript compiler plugin that transforms code during the build process. `babel-plugin-minimact` transpiles TSX to C#, generates hex paths, extracts templates, and detects structural changes for hot reload.

### Bundle Size
The total size of JavaScript files shipped to the client. React + ReactDOM = ~140KB. Minimact client runtime = ~20KB (7x smaller).

---

## C

### Cache Hit
When the HintQueue successfully matches a state change to a cached prediction, allowing instant DOM updates without server communication. Minimact achieves 94.7% cache hit rate in production.

### Cache Miss
When the HintQueue cannot find a matching prediction for a state change. The client notifies the server, which re-renders and sends patches. Takes ~20-50ms vs 0.1-5ms for cache hits.

### Client State
State maintained on the client for instant interactivity (via cached predictions). Must sync to server to prevent stale data. Different from "client-side state" in SPAs—Minimact's client state is temporary and always reconciled with server.

### Component Context
Execution context for hooks during component rendering. Contains state, effects, refs, component ID, and references to HintQueue, DOMPatcher, and SignalR. Tracked via `currentContext` variable.

### Component Registry
Client-side registry tracking all active component instances. Indexed by instance ID, component type, and file path. Enables multi-instance hot reload (update all `<Counter />` instances simultaneously).

---

## D

### Debouncing
Technique to prevent multiple triggers of the same event within a short time window. Minimact's FileSystemWatcher uses 50ms debouncing to handle rapid Ctrl+S presses without flickering.

### Dehydrationist Architecture
Architecture where the client never renders components—it only displays server-rendered results. Opposite of "hydration" (client re-renders to attach handlers). Eliminates the 140KB React runtime and double-rendering.

### DOM Patch
An instruction to modify the DOM (e.g., UpdateText, UpdateProp, Create, Remove, Replace). Generated by the Rust reconciler, sent via SignalR, applied by DOMPatcher. Average patch application: ~0.5ms.

### DOMPatcher
Client-side component that applies DOM patches by navigating to elements via paths and executing operations (setAttribute, textContent, appendChild, etc.). Core of Minimact's ~20KB client runtime.

---

## E

### Event Handler
Function that responds to user interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.). In Minimact, handlers trigger SignalR calls to server methods, which update state and send patches back.

---

## F

### FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
Mechanism for calling code across language boundaries. Minimact uses FFI to call Rust's reconciler from C# via JSON serialization. Overhead: ~0.65ms (still faster than pure C#).

### FileSystemWatcher
.NET component that monitors file changes. Minimact uses it to detect `.templates.json` and structural changes for hot reload. Includes debouncing and rename handling.

---

## G

### GC (Garbage Collection)
Automatic memory management. C# has GC pauses (10-20ms), Rust doesn't. This is why Minimact's Rust reconciler has consistent 0.9ms performance vs C#'s variable 1.1-3.2ms.

---

## H

### Heisenbug
Bug that changes behavior when you try to observe it (named after Heisenberg's uncertainty principle). Chapter 3 details a Rust compiler optimization bug where adding `println!` made the bug disappear.

### Hex Path
Stable identifier for VNodes using hexadecimal encoding (e.g., `10000000.20000000.30000000`). Ensures unique paths even with 16+ children per level. Converted to DOM indices by PathConverter for O(1) navigation.

### Hint
Cached prediction in the HintQueue. Contains trigger condition (e.g., `count: 5`) and pre-computed patches. When state matches trigger, patches apply instantly.

### HintQueue
Client-side cache of predicted state changes and their corresponding patches. Enables 0.1-5ms updates when predictions match. Part of Minimact's anticipatory rendering strategy.

### Hook
Function that adds stateful logic to components (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, etc.). Minimact implements React's hook API on the server using component context and index tracking.

### Hot Reload
Updating running application code without full restart. Minimact achieves 0.1ms for template changes (666x faster than React's 60-250ms) and 15-40ms for structural changes.

### Hydration
Process where client-side React re-renders server-generated HTML to attach event handlers. Requires shipping full React runtime (140KB) and double-rendering. Minimact eliminates this entirely.

---

## I

### Instance Replacement
Hot reload strategy for structural changes (added/removed hooks). Creates new component instance, restores compatible state, swaps in registry. Takes ~10-20ms but preserves state.

---

## J

### JSX
JavaScript XML syntax for writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. Minimact's Babel plugin transpiles JSX to C# method calls while preserving React's developer experience.

---

## K

### Key
Stable identifier for list items to help reconciliation match elements across renders. Minimact uses keys for dynamic lists but relies on hex paths for static structure (O(1) lookup).

---

## L

### Loop Template
Template for `.map()` expressions that render lists. Most complex template type—includes conditional logic, nested bindings, and structural metadata. Extracted by Babel at build time.

---

## M

### MES (Minimact Extension Standards)
Quality standards for Minimact extensions with Bronze/Silver/Gold certification levels. Defines requirements for context integration, cleanup, HintQueue support, and TypeScript declarations.

### Minimact
**Min**imal **A**nticipatory **C**lient **T**echnology. Server-side React architecture achieving 0.1ms hot reload, ~20KB bundles, and 100% prediction accuracy through dehydrationist architecture and template-based rendering.

### Minimact Swig
Electron-based IDE for Minimact development. Features Monaco editor, component inspector, integrated terminal, auto-transpilation, and hot reload visual feedback. "Swig" refers to quick/easy usage.

---

## O

### O(1) Lookup
Constant-time operation regardless of data size. Minimact's path-based HashMap reconciliation achieves O(1) child matching (vs React's O(n²) key-based approach).

---

## P

### Patch
See **DOM Patch**.

### PathConverter
Rust component that converts hex paths to DOM indices, accounting for VNull nodes (conditionally rendered elements). Enables O(1) element navigation for hot reload and patch application.

### Playground Bridge
Optional component providing visual feedback in Minimact Swig IDE (cache hits/misses, latency metrics, patch counts). Not needed in production.

### Prediction Accuracy
Percentage of state changes that match cached predictions. Minimact achieves 94.7% overall (98.2% for useState, 91.3% for form inputs, 82.4% for complex logic).

### Predictive Rendering
See **Anticipatory Rendering**.

---

## R

### Reconciliation
Process of comparing old and new VNode trees to generate minimal DOM patches. Minimact's Rust reconciler takes ~0.9ms with consistent performance (no GC pauses).

### Ref
Hook for accessing DOM elements or storing mutable values (`useRef`). In Minimact, refs persist across hot reloads and can reference server-generated elements via hex paths.

---

## S

### Server State
Authoritative state on the server. Client state is temporary cache that must sync back to prevent stale data. Server state survives page reloads and is source of truth.

### SignalR
Microsoft's real-time communication library using WebSockets. Minimact uses SignalR for bidirectional client-server communication (events up, patches down). ~8ms local latency.

### SignalRManager (SignalM)
Minimact's lightweight SignalR client (~3KB). Handles connection, reconnection, message routing, and state synchronization. Part of the ~20KB client runtime.

### Slot
Placeholder in a template (e.g., `{0}`, `{1}`) filled with actual values at runtime. Enables templates to work with any state value without re-rendering.

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
Rendering HTML on the server before sending to client. Traditional SSR requires hydration. Minimact does SSR without hydration (dehydrationist architecture).

### State Synchronization
Keeping client and server state consistent. Critical in Minimact—client state changes must sync to server via `signalR.updateComponentState()` to prevent stale data bugs.

### Structural Change
Code change affecting component structure (add/remove elements, change hooks). Requires full re-render and reconciliation. Minimact handles via instance replacement (~15-40ms).

### Structural Hot Reload
Hot reload strategy for structural changes. Replaces component instance, preserves compatible state, re-renders, reconciles, and applies patches. Slower than template hot reload but still faster than React.

---

## T

### Template
Pre-extracted rendering pattern with slots for dynamic values. Example: `<span>Count: {count}</span>` becomes `{template: "Count: {0}", bindings: ["count"]}`. Enables instant rendering without server round-trip.

### Template Hot Reload
Hot reload strategy for content changes (text, attributes). Applies template patches directly to DOM (~0.1ms). No re-rendering needed—just `setAttribute()` or `textContent = ...`.

### Template Patch System
Minimact's core innovation: extract templates at build time (Babel), render with slots at runtime (server), apply with bindings instantly (client). Achieves 100% prediction accuracy without learning phase.

### Template Source
Origin of a template: **BabelGenerated** (build-time extraction, 100% accurate), **RuntimeExtracted** (Rust observes patterns, 80% initial), or **BabelRefined** (Babel + Rust validation, 100% after confirmation).

### TodoMVC
Standard benchmark app (todo list) used to compare frameworks. Minimact's TodoMVC achieves 0.1ms hot reload and ~0.5ms reconciliation for 100-item lists.

### Transpiler
Tool that converts code from one language to another. `babel-plugin-minimact` transpiles TSX to C# while preserving React's component model and hook API.

---

## U

### useState
Hook for managing component state. In Minimact, implemented on server using component context. State changes sync to client via `signalR.updateComponentState()` to prevent stale data.

### useEffect
Hook for side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, etc.). In Minimact, runs on server after render. Cleanup functions called before next effect or component unmount.

### useRef
Hook for mutable values that persist across renders. In Minimact, stored in component context. Can reference DOM elements via hex paths.

### useServerTask
Advanced hook for async operations with loading/error states and cancellation. Optimized for server-side execution with task pooling and resource management.

---

## V

### VNode (Virtual Node)
Lightweight representation of a DOM element. Contains tag, attributes, children, and hex path. Used for reconciliation—comparing old vs new VNodes generates patches.

### VNull
Special VNode representing conditionally absent elements (e.g., `{false && <Menu />}`). Crucial for path stability—VNull occupies a position in the tree even when not rendered, so sibling paths don't shift.

### VText
VNode representing text content. Simplest VNode type—just contains text string and hex path. Most common template target.

---

## W

### WebSocket
Bidirectional communication channel between browser and server. Minimact uses SignalR over WebSockets for real-time event handling and patch delivery (~8ms latency locally).

---

## Numbers

### 0.1ms
Minimact's hot reload time for template changes. Single `setAttribute()` or `textContent` operation. **666x faster** than React Fast Refresh (60-250ms). Achieved via template patch system and surgical DOM updates.

### 20KB
Minimact's client bundle size (minimact-client.min.js). Includes SignalRManager, DOMPatcher, HintQueue, and TemplateRenderer. **7x smaller** than React + ReactDOM (140KB).

### 0.9ms
Minimact's Rust reconciler performance for typical components. Consistent across runs (no GC pauses). **3.4x faster** than optimized C# (1.1-3.2ms with GC).

### 94.7%
Overall cache hit rate (predictions matching actual state changes). Breaks down as: useState (98.2%), button clicks (96.8%), form inputs (91.3%), complex logic (82.4%).

### 100%
Template prediction accuracy from day one. No learning phase needed because templates are extracted at build time via static analysis (Babel), not inferred from observations.

### 140KB
React + ReactDOM production bundle size. Required for client-side rendering and hydration. Minimact eliminates this by using server-side rendering without hydration.

### 666x
Speed improvement of Minimact's template hot reload (0.15ms avg) vs React Fast Refresh (100ms avg). Achieved by skipping re-transpilation, re-rendering, reconciliation, and diffing—just direct DOM patching.

---

## Patterns & Concepts

### Dehydration
**Opposite of hydration.** Instead of client re-rendering server HTML (hydration), client just displays server HTML (dehydration). No client-side component code needed.

### Hint-Based Prediction
Caching anticipated state changes as "hints" (trigger + patches). When state matches hint trigger, patches apply instantly without server communication.

### O(1) Reconciliation
Minimact's path-based HashMap child matching. Finding old node by path takes constant time regardless of sibling count (vs React's O(n²) key-based search).

### Path Stability
Hex paths remain constant across renders (unless structure changes). Enables instant element lookup for hot reload and patch application.

### Surgical Patching
Updating only the specific DOM node that changed, rather than re-rendering entire component tree. Enabled by stable hex paths and template system.

### Template-Based Rendering
Pre-extract rendering patterns at build time, render with slots at runtime. Eliminates need for client-side reconciliation while maintaining React's component model.

### Zero-Hydration SSR
Server-side rendering that never requires client-side re-rendering. Client displays server HTML and applies patches—never evaluates JSX or reconciles VNodes.
