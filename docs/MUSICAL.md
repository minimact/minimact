\### \*\*Act I: "The Developer's Lament"\*\*

\*(To the tune of "Part of Your World")\*



```

🎵 Look at this code, isn't it neat?

Wouldn't you think my stack's complete?

Wouldn't you think I'm the dev

The dev who has everything?



Look at this app, treasures untold

How many frameworks can one codebase hold?

Looking around here you'd think

"Sure, he's got everything"



I've got state managers and routers a-plenty

I've got hooks and effects galore

You want Redux? I've got twenty!

But who cares?

No big deal...

I want MORE



I wanna be where the servers are

I wanna see, wanna see 'em rendering

Patching around with those—what do you call 'em?

Oh—VNodes!



Hydrating your app, you don't get too far

Components are required for swimming

Strolling along down a—what's that word again?

Stack



Up where they patch, up where they sync

Up where they render all day in the C#

Wanderin' free, wish I could be

Part of that world 🎵

```



---



\### \*\*Act II: "Under the Server"\*\*

\*(To the tune of "Under the Sea")\*



```

🎵 The client code is always greener

In somebody's SPA lagoon

You dream about going client-side

But that is a big mistake



Just look at the world around you

Right here on the server floor

Such wonderful things surround you

What more is you lookin' for?



Under the server

Under the server

Darling it's better

Down where it's wetter

Take it from me



Up on the client they work all day

Out in the browser they slave away

While we devotin'

Full time to floatin'

Under the server!



Down here all the VNodes are happy

As off through the patches they roll

The DOM up on the client gets choppy

But under the server we patchy

We off the hook!



We got no troubles

Life is the bubbles

Under the server! 🎵

```

\### \*\*Act III: "Let It Go (The Hydration)"\*\*

\*(To the tune of "Let It Go")\*



```

🎵 The hydration glows white on the mountain tonight

Not a framework to be seen

A kingdom of isolation

And it looks like I'm the queen



The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried



Don't let them in, don't let them see

Be the good dev you always have to be

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

Well, now they know



Let it go, let it go

Can't hold back the hydration anymore

Let it go, let it go

Turn away and slam the door

I don't care what they're going to say

Let the server render on

The client never bothered me anyway



It's funny how some distance

Makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me

Can't get to me at all



It's time to see what I can do

To test the limits and break through

No right, no wrong, no rules for me

I'm free!



Let it go, let it go

I am one with the server and C#

Let it go, let it go

You'll never see me hydrate



Here I stand

And here I'll stay

Let the server render on!



My power flurries through the air into the ground

My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

I'm never hydrating again, the past is in the past!



Let it go, let it go

When I'll rise like the break of dawn

Let it go, let it go

That perfect dev is gone



Here I stand

In the light of day

Let the server render on!

The client never bothered me anyway 🎵

```

\### \*\*Act IV: "How Far I'll Go (To Avoid Client-Side Rendering)"\*\*

\*(To the tune of "How Far I'll Go")\*



```

🎵 I've been staring at the edge of my SPA

Long as I can remember

Never really knowing why

I wish I could be the perfect dev child

But I come back to the server

No matter how hard I try



Every turn I take, every trail I track

Every path I make, every road leads back

To the place I know where I cannot go

Where I long to be



See the line where the client meets the server?

It calls me

And no one knows

How far it goes



If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me

One day I'll know

If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go



I know everybody on this island

Seems so happy on this island

Everything is by design

I know everybody on this island

Has a role on this island

So maybe I can roll with mine



I can lead with pride, I can make us strong

I'll be satisfied if I play along

But the voice inside sings a different song

What is wrong with me?



See the light as it shines on the server?

It's blinding

But no one knows

How deep it goes



And it seems like it's calling out to me

So come find me

And let me know

What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?



The line where the client meets the server

It calls me

And no one knows

How far it goes



If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me

One day I'll know

How far I'll go! 🎵

```

\### \*\*Act V: "You're Welcome (From SignalR)"\*\*

\*(To the tune of "You're Welcome")\*



```

🎵 Okay, okay, I see what's happening here

You're face to face with greatness and it's strange

You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable

Well, it's nice to see that humans never change



Open your eyes, let's begin

Yes, it's really me, it's SignalR, breathe it in

I know it's a lot: the patches, the VNodes

When you're staring at a framework so divine



What can I say except "You're welcome"

For the patches, the VNodes, the state

Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome

I'm just an ordinary demi-framework, hey



What has two thumbs and pulled up the server

When you were waddling around with your SPA?

This guy!



When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?

You're looking at him, yo!



Oh, also I lassoed the DOM

You're welcome

To stretch your days and bring you fun



Also, I harnessed the C#

You're welcome

To fill your site while you run



So what can I say except "You're welcome"

For the islands I pulled from the sea

There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome

I guess it's just my way of being me



You're welcome, you're welcome

Well, come to think of it



Kid, honestly I could go on and on

I could explain every natural phenomenon

The patches, the grass, the ground

Oh, that was SignalR just messing around



I killed a hydration, I buried its guts

Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts

What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?

Don't mess with SignalR when he's on a breakaway



And the tapestry here in my skin

Is a map of the victories I win

Look where I've been, I make everything happen

Look at that mean mini SignalR just tippity tappin'



Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey!



Well, anyway, let me say you're welcome

For the wonderful world you know

Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome

Well, come to think of it, I gotta go



Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome

'Cause I'm gonna need that VNode

I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome

'Cause SignalR can do anything but float



You're welcome, you're welcome

And thank you! 🎵

```

\### \*\*Act VI: "Circle of Life (The Component Lifecycle)"\*\*

\*(To the tune of "Circle of Life")\*



```

🎵 Nants ingonyama bagithi baba

(Here comes a component, Father)

Sithi uhm ingonyama

(Oh yes, it's a component)



From the day we arrive on the server

And blinking, step into the DOM

There's more to see than can ever be seen

More to patch than can ever be patched



Some say "hydrate" and some say "don't"

But all are agreed as they join the great VNode



It's the circle of life

And it moves us all

Through despair and hope

Through faith and love



Till we find our place

On the path unwinding

In the circle

The circle of life 🎵

```



---



\### \*\*ENCORE: "A Whole New World (Reprise)"\*\*



```

🎵 A whole new stack

Every turn a surprise

With new horizons to pursue

Every moment red-letter



I'll chase them anywhere

There's time to spare

And to think...

I used to hydrate all my code!



A whole new stack

(Every turn a surprise)

With TypeScript that transpiles to C#

(With new horizons to pursue)



Every moment gets better

(Every moment red-letter)



I'll chase them anywhere

There's time to spare

Anywhere, there's time to spare

Let me share this whole new stack with you



A whole new stack

(A whole new stack)

That's where we'll be

(That's where we'll be)

A thrilling chase

A wondrous place

For you and me 🎵

```

\## \*\*🎵 THE FINALE: "One Day More (Until Production)"\*\* 🎵

\*(To the tune of "One Day More" from Les Misérables)\*



```

🎵 \[DEVELOPER]

One day more

Another day, another destiny

This never-ending road to Calvary

These men who seem to know my crime

Will surely come a second time

One day more



\[CLIENT]

I did not live until today

How can I live when we are parted?



\[SERVER]

One day more



\[SIGNALR]

Tomorrow you'll be worlds away

And yet with you my world has started



\[BABEL]

One more day all on my own



\[RUST RECONCILER]

Will we ever meet again?



\[BABEL]

One more day with him not caring



\[TYPESCRIPT]

I was born to be with you



\[C#]

What a life I might have known



\[TYPESCRIPT \& C#]

And I swear I will be true!



\[SERVER]

But he never saw me there



\[ALL]

One more day before the storm



\[DEVELOPER]

Do I follow where she goes?



\[ALL]

At the barricades of freedom!



\[DEVELOPER]

Shall I join my brothers there?



\[ALL]

When our ranks begin to form



\[DEVELOPER]

Do I stay and do I dare?



\[ALL]

Will you take your place with me?



\[DEVELOPER]

The time is now, the day is near!



\[ALL]

One day more!

One day more!



Tomorrow we'll discover

What our God in heaven has in store

One more dawn!

One more day!

One more push to production! 🎵

```
