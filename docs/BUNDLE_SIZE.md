---

## How to Choose

### Use **minimact** (SignalM) if:

✅ You're building for modern browsers (Chrome 51+, Firefox 54+, Safari 10+, Edge 15+)
✅ You want the smallest possible bundle
✅ You only need WebSocket transport
✅ You don't need custom SignalR hubs (useSignalR hook)

**Example:**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/minimact.min.js"></script>
```

```typescript
import { Minimact } from 'minimact';
```

---

### Use **minimact-r** (SignalR) if:

✅ You need enterprise compatibility (old proxies, firewalls)
✅ You need transport fallback (SSE, Long Polling)
✅ You need MessagePack protocol
✅ You want to use custom SignalR hubs (useSignalR hook)

**Example:**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/minimact-r.min.js"></script>
```

```typescript
import { Minimact } from 'minimact/minimact-r';
```

---

## Migration Between Versions

### Switching from minimact-r → minimact (downgrade for size)

**No code changes required!** Just change your import:

```diff
- import { Minimact } from 'minimact/minimact-r';
+ import { Minimact } from 'minimact';
```

Or change your script tag:

```diff
- <script src="https://cdn.example.com/minimact-r.min.js"></script>
+ <script src="https://cdn.example.com/minimact.min.js"></script>
```

**Note:** If you're using `useSignalR` hook, you must use `minimact-r`.

---

### Switching from minimact → minimact-r (upgrade for features)

**No code changes required!** Just change your import:

```diff
- import { Minimact } from 'minimact';
+ import { Minimact } from 'minimact/minimact-r';
```

Or change your script tag:

```diff
- <script src="https://cdn.example.com/minimact.min.js"></script>
+ <script src="https://cdn.example.com/minimact-r.min.js"></script>
```

---

## Browser Support

### Minimact (SignalM)

**Requires:**
- WebSocket API (all modern browsers)
- ES2015+ (Chrome 51+, Firefox 54+, Safari 10+, Edge 15+)

**Coverage:** ~95% of global users (caniuse.com/websockets)

---

### Minimact-R (SignalR)

**Requires:**
- Modern browsers: WebSocket
- Legacy browsers: SSE or Long Polling fallback

**Coverage:** ~99% of global users (includes IE11 with polyfills)

---

## Build Analysis

Both versions generate bundle analysis reports:

- `stats-signalm.html` - SignalM version breakdown
- `stats-signalr.html` - SignalR version breakdown

These visualizations show exactly what's in each bundle and where the bytes are coming from.

## Performance Impact

### Network Transfer

| Version | Download Time (3G) | Download Time (4G) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| minimact | ~180ms | ~50ms |
| minimact-r | ~333ms | ~95ms |

*Based on average mobile speeds: 3G = 400 Kbps, 4G = 2 Mbps*

### Parse Time

| Version | Parse + Compile |
|---------|----------------|
| minimact | ~40-60ms |
| minimact-r | ~75-100ms |

*Measured on mid-range mobile devices*

---

## Recommendation

**Start with `minimact` (SignalM version)**

You can always upgrade to `minimact-r` later if you need the extra features. The migration is seamless with zero code changes.

**99% of applications will be perfectly served by the lightweight SignalM version.**

## Technical Details

### What makes SignalM smaller?

SignalM removes:
- ❌ Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport
- ❌ Long Polling fallback
- ❌ MessagePack protocol
- ❌ Transport negotiation logic
- ❌ Streaming APIs (IAsyncEnumerable)

SignalM keeps:
- ✅ WebSocket transport
- ✅ JSON protocol
- ✅ Automatic reconnection
- ✅ Exponential backoff
- ✅ Full hub compatibility

**Result:** Same developer experience, 47% smaller bundle.

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use both versions in the same app?

**A:** No, you should choose one. They provide the same API but with different transports.

---

### Q: Will my server code work with both?

**A:** Yes! Both versions are compatible with the same ASP.NET Core SignalR hubs. The server doesn't know or care which client you're using.

---

### Q: Is SignalM production-ready?

**A:** Yes! SignalM uses the same SignalR JSON protocol and has been tested for reliability, reconnection, and error handling.

---

### Q: What if my environment blocks WebSockets?

**A:** Use `minimact-r` (SignalR version) which has fallback transports (SSE, Long Polling).

---

### Q: How do I know which version my app is using?

**A:** Check the bundle name or import path:
- `minimact` → SignalM (lightweight)
- `minimact/minimact-r` → SignalR (full)

You can also check in the browser console:
```javascript
console.log(window.Minimact.VERSION);
```
