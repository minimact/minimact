features:
  - icon: ðŸŒµ
    title: Zero Hydration
    details: No client-side VDOM reconciliation. No hydration waterfall. The server pre-computes everything.

  - icon: âš¡
    title: Predictive Patches
    details: Rust engine pre-renders UI updates before user interaction. Patches cached and ready instantly.

  - icon: ðŸŽ¯
    title: 13.33 KB Bundle
    details: 71% smaller than React. WebSocket-based real-time sync. No bloat, just performance.

  - icon: ðŸ”„
    title: Server-First Architecture
    details: All rendering happens on ASP.NET Core. Client only applies patches. Security by design.

  - icon: ðŸ“¦
    title: React Syntax
    details: Write familiar JSX/TSX with hooks. Transpiles to C#. No new syntax to learn.

  - icon: ðŸš€
    title: 2-3ms Interactions
    details: Cached patches execute instantly. 15Ã— faster than traditional server rendering on 3G.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run Swig - the official Minimact IDE
git clone https://github.com/minimact/swig
cd swig
npm install
npm start
```

### Create Your First App

Once Swig launches:

1. **Create Project** - Click "New Project" and choose a directory
2. **Edit Components** - Write TSX in Monaco editor (auto-transpiles to C#)
3. **Build** - Click "Build" to compile your app
4. **Run** - Click "Run" and open in browser

That's it! From zero to running app in under 2 minutes.

**Two runtime versions available:**
- `@minimact/core` â€” 13.33 KB gzipped (WebSocket-based, modern browsers)
- `@minimact/core/r` â€” 25.03 KB gzipped (Full SignalR with fallbacks)

## Example

Write familiar React code:

```tsx
import { useState } from '@minimact/core';

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Babel transpiles to C#, Rust predicts the next state, and the client applies cached patches instantly (~2-3ms).

## Why Minimact?

### For React Developers
**Finally, a path to .NET without learning Razor.** Keep writing React â€” get ASP.NET Core's power, security, and enterprise features.

**Bundle size:** 13.33 KB vs React's 45 KB (71% smaller!)

### For .NET Teams
**Modern frontend DX without abandoning your stack.** Your team already knows C# and EF Core. Now they can build UIs with React syntax.

**Performance:** 2-3ms interactions vs 47ms traditional SSR

### For CTOs
**Solve the "React DX + .NET backend" problem.** One stack, one deployment, full type safety from database to DOM. Rust-powered performance makes ASP.NET Core shine.

**Comparison:**
- React 18: 45 KB gzipped
- Vue 3: 34 KB gzipped
- **Minimact: 13.33 KB gzipped** (71% smaller than React)

### Better Than Blazor
Blazor requires learning Razor syntax. Minimact uses React â€” the syntax millions of developers already know. Lower barrier, faster adoption, bigger talent pool.
