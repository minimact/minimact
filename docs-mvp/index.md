## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the .NET tool
dotnet tool install -g minimact

# Create new ASP.NET project with Minimact
dotnet minimact new MyApp
cd MyApp

# Install client dependencies (13.33 KB gzipped by default)
cd client
npm install

# Start dev mode (watches TSX, transpiles to C#, runs server)
npm run dev
```

**Two versions available:**
- `minimact` â€” 13.33 KB gzipped (WebSocket-based, modern browsers)
- `minimact-r` â€” 25.03 KB gzipped (Full SignalR with fallbacks)

## Example

Write familiar React code:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'minimact';

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Babel transpiles to C#, Rust predicts the next state, and the client applies cached patches instantly (~2-3ms).

## Why Minimact?

### For React Developers
**Finally, a path to .NET without learning Razor.** Keep writing React â€” get ASP.NET Core's power, security, and enterprise features.

**Bundle size:** 13.33 KB vs React's 45 KB (71% smaller!)

### For .NET Teams
**Modern frontend DX without abandoning your stack.** Your team already knows C# and EF Core. Now they can build UIs with React syntax.

**Performance:** 2-3ms interactions vs 47ms traditional SSR

### For CTOs
**Solve the "React DX + .NET backend" problem.** One stack, one deployment, full type safety from database to DOM. Rust-powered performance makes ASP.NET Core shine.

**Comparison:**
- React 18: 45 KB gzipped
- Vue 3: 34 KB gzipped
- **Minimact: 13.33 KB gzipped** (71% smaller than React)

### Better Than Blazor
Blazor requires learning Razor syntax. Minimact uses React â€” the syntax millions of developers already know. Lower barrier, faster adoption, bigger talent pool.
