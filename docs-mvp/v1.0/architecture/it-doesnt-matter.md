*The Rock's music hits*
*Entire framework ecosystem shakes*

## üì£ THE ROCK HAS SOMETHING TO SAY...

**To React:**
*"Oh, so you're the 'industry standard'? You've got 45KB of runtime, useTransition, useDeferredValue, Suspense boundaries..."*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still making users download megabytes of JavaScript!
You're still hydrating like it's 2015!
You're still pretending 16ms latency is "fast enough"!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** 13.33 KB. 0ms latency. **KNOW YOUR ROLE!**

---

**To Vue:**
*"Oh, you've got the Composition API now? ref() vs reactive()? computed() vs watch()?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still confusing developers with two mental models!
You're still shipping 35KB of reactivity overhead!
You're still doing client-side work the server should handle!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** One API. One way. **SHUT YOUR MOUTH!**

---

**To Angular:**
*"Oh, you're 'enterprise-grade'? You've got RxJS, decorators, zones, dependency injection..."*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still shipping 500KB+ bundles!
You're still requiring a PhD to understand your architecture!
You're still using Zone.js in 2025!

*"Oh, you've got Server Components? App Router? Edge Runtime? Turbopack?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still hydrating the entire page!
You're still shipping the React runtime!
You're still making developers choose between 47 rendering strategies!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** Server computes. Client executes. **BOOM!**

---

**To Svelte:**
*"Oh, you 'compile away the framework'? You're lightweight? You're reactive?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still doing client-side diffing!
You're still missing predictive rendering!
You're still not server-authoritative!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** Compile time AND runtime. **THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE!**

---

**To Solid:**
*"Oh, you've got fine-grained reactivity? No VDOM? Real DOM updates?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still reactive (not predictive)!
You're still waiting for events to happen!
You're still missing the MVC bridge!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** Predict before it happens. **THE PEOPLE'S ELBOW!**

---

**To Astro:**
*"Oh, you ship zero JavaScript by default? Islands architecture? Partial hydration?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're STILL hydrating (just less of it)!
You're still interactive islands, not predictive ones!
You're still missing real-time updates!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** Zero hydration beats partial hydration. **EVERY TIME!**

---

**To Qwik:**
*"Oh, you've got resumability? You serialize the framework state? You lazy-load everything?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still shipping framework code on demand!
You're still waiting for user interaction to load!
You're still not predicting what happens next!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** Pre-compute, don't lazy-load. **THE PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE!**

---

**To HTMX:**
*"Oh, you're 'HTML-first'? You've got hyperscript? You swap HTML fragments?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still making full server round-trips!
You're still missing predictive caching!
You're still not type-safe across the stack!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** Server predictions, not server round-trips. **SURGICAL PRECISION!**

---

**To Alpine.js:**
*"Oh, you're lightweight? Just 15KB? x-data and x-bind?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still client-side only!
You're still missing server integration!
You're still template strings, not TSX!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** TypeScript safety beats template strings. **ALWAYS!**

**THE ROCK SAYS:** One strategy. One way. **THE RIGHT WAY!**

---

**To SolidStart:**
*"Oh, you're Solid but with routing? Server functions? Streaming SSR?"*

(Same problems as Solid, just with routing)

**THE ROCK SAYS:** *(see Solid section above)* **STILL NOT PREDICTIVE!**

---

**To Fresh:**
*"Oh, you're Preact on Deno? Islands with no build step? Just-in-time rendering?"*

### **IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!**

You're still Preact (React-lite)!

You're still not predicting!

**THE ROCK SAYS:** Fresh? More like STALE! **PREDICTIVE IS THE FUTURE!**
