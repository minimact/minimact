Welcome to the Minimalist community! 🌵

## Who Are Minimalists?

**Minimalists** are developers who use Minimact - embracing minimal code, maximum control, and DOM domination. We're the Posthydrationists who believe the web doesn't need more JavaScript, it needs better architecture.

When you say "I'm a Minimalist," you're not just talking about a framework choice - you're declaring a philosophy:

- ✅ **Never hydrate** - Eliminate the 150-300ms tax
- ✅ **Minimal code** - 13KB runtime vs 45KB+
- ✅ **Maximum control** - Server-first with instant interactivity
- ✅ **DOM domination** - Transform the DOM into a reactive, queryable database

## The Minimalist Identity

![Minimalist T-Shirt](/shirt.png)

### The Official Minimalist Statement

```
🌵 MINIMALIST
Never Hydrate.
Minimal Code.
Maximum Control.
DOM Domination.
```

This isn't just a tagline - it's the four pillars of the Posthydrationist movement:

1. **Never Hydrate** - Reject client-side hydration entirely
2. **Minimal Code** - Achieve more with less (13KB > 45KB)
3. **Maximum Control** - Server-side logic with instant client updates
4. **DOM Domination** - The DOM as data source, not just output

## Minimalist Merch

Show your Minimalist pride!

### The Minimalist T-Shirt

**Front Design:**
- 🌵 **Minimalist** wordmark with cactus icon
- Large cactus graphic (representing resilience and minimalism)
- The four pillars: Never Hydrate, Minimal Code, Maximum Control, DOM Domination

**Perfect for:**
- Conferences and meetups
- Daily development wear
- Identifying fellow Minimalists
- Starting conversations about Posthydrationism

---

### The Posthydrationist Banner

![Posthydrationist Banner](/banner.png)

**The Official Rally Flag:**

```
NEVER
HYDRATE.
ALWAYS
MINIMACT.
🌵
```

Bold, minimal, declarative. The battle cry of the Posthydrationist movement.

**Perfect for:**
- **Conference booths** - Hang at your Minimact booth
- **Office spaces** - Declare your team's philosophy
- **Dev team rooms** - "This is a Minimalist team"
- **Meetup venues** - Mark the Minimalist gathering spot
- **Live coding streams** - Background statement piece

**Use cases:**
- Display at conferences to attract fellow Minimalists
- Hang in engineering spaces to set architectural principles
- Gift to teams adopting Minimact
- Mark "hydration-free zones" in your office
- Conference stage backdrop for Minimact talks

This isn't just decoration - it's a statement of architectural intent. When you hang this banner, you're declaring: "We reject hydration waterfalls. We embrace server-first architecture. We are Minimalists."

### Why the Cactus? 🌵

The cactus is the perfect symbol for Minimalists:

- **Resilient** - Thrives in harsh conditions (just like our apps on slow networks)
- **Minimal** - Needs very little to survive (13KB runtime!)
- **Never hydrates** - Literally doesn't need water (ironic perfection)
- **Protective** - Has spines to ward off bloat and complexity
- **Beautiful simplicity** - Elegant form with zero waste

---

## Community Values

### 1. Performance First
We measure success in milliseconds, not features. Every line of code must justify its existence.

**Minimalist metrics:**
- Time to Interactive: 2-3ms (not 150-300ms)
- Bundle size: 12.01KB (not 45KB+)
- State updates: 0-1ms predicted (not 16-32ms)

### 2. Server-Side Truth
The server maintains truth. The client is a fast, lightweight patch applier. No state duplication, no hydration waterfalls.

### 3. Predictive, Not Reactive
Don't wait for users to act - predict their next move and pre-compute patches. Cache hits = 0ms latency.

### 4. Structure ≠ Behavior
Decouple what elements look like from what they do. No wrapper div hell. Use bundles and behavioral primitives.

### 5. Minimal Over Maximal
We don't compete on feature count. We compete on doing more with less code.

## Minimalist Philosophy in Action

### What We Build

Minimalists build applications that are:

- ⚡ **Blazing fast** - 0-1ms updates, no hydration delay
- 📦 **Lightweight** - 13KB client runtime
- 🔄 **Real-time** - SignalR state sync
- 🧠 **Intelligent** - Rust predictor learns patterns
- 🎯 **Precise** - Surgical DOM patches, not full re-renders
- 🌐 **Server-first** - Logic on server, not duplicated

### What We Avoid

Minimalists reject:

- ❌ **Hydration waterfalls** - We never hydrate
- ❌ **Bundle bloat** - No 45KB frameworks
- ❌ **Wrapper divs** - Use bundles instead
- ❌ **State duplication** - Server maintains truth
- ❌ **VDOM reconciliation** - Direct patches instead
- ❌ **Client-side complexity** - Keep it on the server

## Final Thought

Welcome to the Minimalist community. You're not just using a framework - you're joining a movement to make the web faster, leaner, and more developer-friendly.

Together, we're proving that **less is more**. That **server-first works**. That **hydration is optional**. That **13KB can do what 45KB used to**.

**Welcome, Minimalist.** 🌵✨
