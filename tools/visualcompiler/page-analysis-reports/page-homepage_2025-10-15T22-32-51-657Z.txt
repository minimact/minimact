🔴 P2 [CRITICAL] Component overlap cluster affecting MainLayout, FailSquareCard, FailSquareButton
   Impact: blocks-interaction | Users: 100% | Fix Effort: medium | Confidence: 80%
   Root Cause: Layout positioning conflicts
   Affected Components: MainLayout, FailSquareCard, FailSquareButton
   💡 SUGGESTED FIX:
      Fix positioning conflicts between MainLayout and FailSquareCard and FailSquareButton
      CSS: [data-component="MainLayout"], [data-component="FailSquareCard"], [data-component="FailSquareButton"]
      
      /* Fix overlapping components */
      .mainlayout {

      .failsquarecard {
        position: relative;
        clear: both;
        margin-top: 8px;
      }
      Explanation: Establishes proper stacking order and spacing to prevent overlaps
      Alternative fixes:
        • Use CSS Grid for precise positioning: display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 16px;
